        Time is flowing. What is SPACE, TIME AND EINSTEIN the flow of time? Is
        time the same asphysical change, or is it the cause of change?These
        questions about space and time seem idle at first. Can time proceed
        without change? Does it flow at a speed ofone hour per . hour?If no body
        moves through a space does time still flow there? . Is it happening
        there in the empty space betweenyour palms, or in the space your brain
        occupies? Is itspace, a vacuum, a place? Canyou feel time flowing there?
        But we think of air as composed of separatemolecules, like isolated
        islands. But we havelearned otherwise.Consider one time and place. This
        is our second question. . Is that the right metaphor?Does time flow more
        slowly and more quickly, or at a steady rate?If steady, then steady
        compared to what? Your brain is sensitive tothe physical passage of time
        and as each second or so passes it rousesitself and decides to stimulate
        your heartbeat, sending blood coursingdown through your palms. Does time
        flow invisibly through the space between your palms, asblood flows
        through your fingers or as a river flows past it banks? Cup your hands
        together and peer down between your palms.What is between them?One
        answer is “air”. Could there be more“nothing” between some, and less
        “nothing” between others? It is tasteless, colourlessand weightless.
        What is between your cupped palms? It is notclear even how to begin, how
        to get a grip on them. On 6 August 1945, early on a brightsunny morning
        in the city of Hiroshima, tea was being made inoffices, children were
        being bundled off to school and a lonely,propeller-driven plane buzzed
        unnoticed through the sky above.When the atom bomb fell, the furious,
        boiling ball of fire killed someone hundred thousand human beings at
        once. What lies between the molecules?Nothing?The distances between the
        molecules differ. Is it something or nothing?Now pause silently for a
        moment until you can feel the bloodpulsing through your hands. It does
        not move, and the gentlest breeze can passthrough it without
        resistance.This is our first question. Couldnothing really exist?The
        empty space does seem to be nothing. Is it there at all?

        Marx was born in Trier on 5 May 1818. There was considerable discontent
        following incorporation of the Rhineland into Prussia in 1814. Yet to a
        remarkable extent he does himself epitomise his own doctrine that men
        are conditioned by their socio-economic circumstances. A community of
        about 15,000 inhabitants, it was the oldest city in Germany1 and also
        one of the loveliest - situated as it was in the Mosel valley,
        surrounded by vineyards and luxuriating in an almost Mediterranean
        vegetation. But it was not just the city of Roman times that influenced
        him: during the Napoleonic wars, together with the rest of the
        Rhineland, it had been annexed by France and governed long enough in
        accordance with the principles of the French Revolution to be imbued by
        a taste for freedom of speech and constitutional liberty
        uncharacteristic of the rest of Germany. Trier had very little industry
        and its inhabitants were mainly officials, traders and artisans. The
        sense of alienation was heightened in Marx's personal case by his
        subsequent inability to obtain a teaching post in a university system
        that had no room for dissident intellectuals. It may seem paradoxical
        that Karl Marx, whom so many working-class movements of our time claim
        as their Master and infallible guide to revolution, should have come
        from a comfortable middle-class home. Marx did not only get his lifelong
        Rhineland accent from Trier: more importantly, his absorbing passion for
        history originated in the very environment of his adolescence. Their
        activities were largely bound up with the vineyards whose prosperity,
        owing to customs unions and outside competition, was on the decline. The
        German city in which he grew up gave him a sense of long historical
        tradition and at the same time close contact with the grim realities of
        the underdevelopment then characteristic of Germany. In the Middle Ages
        the city had been the seat of a PrinceArchbishop whose lands stretched
        as far as Metz, Toul and Verdun; it was said that it contained more
        churches than any other German city of comparable size. Thoroughly
        Jewish in their origins, Protestant by necessity yet living in a
        Catholic region, his family could never regard their social integration
        as complete. The Porta Nigra, in whose shadow (literally) Marx grew up,
        and the enormous fourth-century basilica were enduring monuments of
        Trier's 9 3 6 KAR L MARX : A BIOGRAPH Y imperial glory.

        He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified.
        For some reason or other, we did not begin that game of dominoes. The
        director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat
        down amongst us. Afterward, there was silence on board the yacht. We
        exchanged a few words lazily. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had,
        because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
        and was lying on the superior rug. We four affectionately watched his
        back as he stood in the bows looking seaward. The Nellie, a cruising
        yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was at
        rest. On the whole river, there was nothing that looked half so
        nautical. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the
        mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back,
        an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands
        outwards, resembled an idol. A haze rested on the low shores that ran
        out to sea in vanishing flatness. The flood had made, the wind was
        nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was
        to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.The sea-reach of the Thames
        stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway.
        Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation,
        it made us tolerant of each other's yarns—and even convictions. The
        Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying
        architecturally with the bones. The air was dark above Gravesend, and
        farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding
        motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.The
        Director of Companies was our captain and our host. It was difficult to
        realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind
        him, within the brooding gloom. Between us, there was, as I have already
        said somewhere, Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com the bond of the sea. In
        the offing, the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint,
        and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up
        with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply
        peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits.
